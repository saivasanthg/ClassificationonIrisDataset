This repository contains code for a classification project on the Iris dataset using Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning, containing samples of three different species of iris flowers. This project demonstrates the use of different classification algorithms to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.
